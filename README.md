# networkedwebsitesdetector

The goal of networkedwebsitesdetector is to offer a structured approach
for finding websites which have clear signs of common ownership or are
otherwise related.

## Installation

You can install the released version of networkedwebsitesdetector from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("giocomai/networkedwebsitesdetector")
```

As of this writing (2019-05-24), the package works with the development
versions of both `tidyr` and `googledrive` and will result in errors
with the current cran versions.

``` r
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/googledrive")
```
