# networkedwebsitesdetector

The goal of networkedwebsitesdetector is to offer a structured approach for finding websites which have clear signs of common ownership or are otherwise related.

## Installation

You can install the released version of networkedwebsitesdetector from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("giocomai/networkedwebsitesdetector")
```

As of this writing (`r Sys.Date()`), the package works with the development versions of both `tidyr` and `googledrive` and will result in errors with the current cran versions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/googledrive")
```
